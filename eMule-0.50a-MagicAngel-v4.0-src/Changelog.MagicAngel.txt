MERGED: Merged to emule 0.50a (MorphXT 12.6). [YumeYao]

IMPROVED: Changed Preview option on file context menu display logic. [YumeYao]
          If Preview Available -- Always show "Preview" on root menu if only one player specified
                               -- Otherwise "preview" and "preview with" depends on "Display Preview With menu in root context menu" option,
                                  they will be in root menu or preview sub-menu together
          If Not Available -- If "Show more controls" on  -- Same as before except that "Downloading needed parts for previewing" always show
                              If "Show more controls" off -- display "Downloading needed parts for previewing" on root menu with "preview" removed(was grayed before).

         It will show as checked and disabled(grayed) if the global option is checked.
