	How to compile eMule MorphXT using Visual Studio 2005 SP1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have Visual Studio 2005 SP1 and latest updates/hotfixes installed!!!

   Here is a list reference(sorted by importance highest to lowest):

   KB926601 - SP1 - Must Have!
   KB971090 - ATL Security Update - Must Have!
   KB949009 - Win7SDK/VS2008 Lib/obj files Compatiblity Patch - Must Have!
   KB929470 - Update for running on Vista/7 - Must Have if you're running with Vista/7!
   KB980422 - Hotfix for compiler tools - Suggested
   KB2435944 - NORETURN functions Fix - Suggested
   KB947315 - C++ Intellisense Hang Fix - Suggested

   Please install all the updates/hotfixes marked as "Must Have" before you start compiling eMule, otherwise you're wasting time.

   It's also suggested that you install all the hotfixes marked as "Suggested".

2. Download Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 here:

	Full ISO Image: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=71DEB800-C591-4F97-A900-BEA146E4FAE1&displaylang=en

	or

	Web Install: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505&displaylang=en

3. Start Web Install or Setup.Exe on the ISO image.

4. Decide on install folder.

5. Check 'Windows Headers and Libaries'. This is just enough for compiling MorphXT. If you want to install anything else 
   do it but it is not required. Basically, you will only waste space on your hard drive.

6. Wait a quarter of a century for the installation to finish... Actually, it is pretty fast if you do as we suggest.

7. When the installation is finished go to Start --> All Programs --> Microsoft Windows SDK v7.0 --> Visual Studio Registration
   and start Windows SDK Configuration Tool. Follow the instructions and register the new SDK to Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

8. Start $Source Dir$\srchybrid\emule80.sln and pick build type you want to compile.

9. Be happy with this new fine MorphXT Release.


NOTE: The provided sources contain all additionally required Microsoft SDK includes and libs so this is just about ready to compile.
