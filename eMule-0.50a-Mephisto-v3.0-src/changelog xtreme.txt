Release-Notes:
blocking-ratio and upload health:
after turning on this option in Xtreme I you will see some new values at the transferwindow. The first value inside the uploadtoolbar is your upload-health. This value should always be 100% if not, please review your upload-settings. The second value is the 20sec-avg-blocking-count of all sockets.
At your uploadslots you'll also find a new value, the 20-sec-avg-blocking-ratio. This is the ratio how oftenly the socket blocked our try to send at the last 20 sec. E.g. 95% would mean: only 5% of our sending-tries was successful.


option to remove blocking sockets:
works only if you enabled the option to open more sockets if needed. Now if your uploadslots grow three slots over the minimum-slots Xtreme looks if there is a slot uploading >3 minutes and has a high blocking-ratio. This slot will be removed.
Please use this option with caution!


auto-update-ipfilter works like this:
- after you enabled the option... the next restart of the client the ipfilter will be downloaded and the date of this version will be stored
- on next restart of you clients the ipfilter will be checked in the same interval as versions-check (you can set it at general settings). If it is time to do a check Xtreme will connect to the URL you specified at security-settings. After connection is established Xtreme checks if the version on server is newer than your installed version. If so, your ipfilter will be updated.

*max global sourcelimit:
depending on your uploadlimit you'll get a max global sourcelimit. (e.g. for 10kbs upload: sourcelimit = 4000)
This shell avoid overheadleeching, which means: users with only a small upload like 12 kbs, are using 10000 and more sources. Which such an amount of sources, all your bandwidth is wasted with filerequests and there isn't enough bandwidth left for uploading of data. With the max global source limit, xtreme avoids this kind of leeching.
You have two new options: 
- accept the source limit, which means Xtreme won't find more sources
or
- accept a session 1:3 ratio if you are using more sources than global source limit
remark: Xtreme session/amount 1:3 ratio always means: no downloadlimit until you reach a 1:3 ratio. After reaching this, you'll get a downloadlmit of 4*current upload. Overall you'll should reach a ratio between 1:3 and 1:4

remark:
- this mod has no USS (use nafc instead!)
- this mod doesn't allow unlimited uploadspeed
- the adjustable slotspeed is not an accurate speed, but a tolerant(can go 25% over the settings). Xtreme Mod decide itself how much slots are needed to best fit your slotspeed
- the uploadlimit is applied to overhead + data
- if you use NAFC, the uploadlimit is applied to whole networktraffic (also other applications) and downloadlimit is automatically adjusted
- the overhead includes TCP/IP + UDP-Header + blockpackage-header + ACK-packets
- because the uploadlimit is applied to data + whole overhead, you have to set your upload to min 11kbs to get unlimited download, but please set it to about 90% of your uploadcapacity
