-----------------------

-----------------------

-----------------------
.: Fixed the following BETA bugs:
- Popups on the shared files list were not working
- The shared files count in the GUI wasn't always accurate
- Resolved shell links had some issues, preventing them from getting shared
- The GUI wasn't always properly updated when deleting a file in the shared files window

eMule 0.49c BETA2
-----------------------
- Feb, 11. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: Fixed a BETA bug in the new part.met recovery function

-----------------------
- Feb, 10. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: Resolve shared shell links has now its own option in the extend dialog instead beeing a preferences.ini only option
.: Added the preferences.ini only option "FileBufferTimeLimit" ("eMule" section) which lets you set the maximum seconds before flushing the buffer of downloading files (default 60) 

-----------------------
- Feb, 9. 2009        -
-----------------------
.: When another client requests to view your shared files and directories (and you allow it), eMule will now attach only the directory names (or relative paths if it is a shared subdir) instead the full path for privacy reasons
.: Fixed a BETA bug which caused eMule to not send single shared files when answering view shared files requests

-----------------------
- Feb, 8. 2009        -
-----------------------
.: On a fresh eMule installation, several less important list columns are now hidden by default to avoid overloading the interface
.: Fixed some BETA bugs with creating collections
.: Slightly increased the max. button size of the maintoolbar
.: You can no longer share single files within unshareable directories (like your temp dir)

-----------------------
- Feb, 7. 2009        -
-----------------------
.: Fixed a BETA bug which made eMule ignore the longest keyword on server searches
.: Added sanity checks for some problems seen in crashdumps when sending responses
.: Added sanity range check for preferences.ini only option: tcp obfuscation padding length

eMule 0.49c BETA1
-----------------------
- Feb, 4. 2009        -
-----------------------
.: Dates shown in the download list have their own time format setting ("DateTimeFormat4Lists" in preferences.ini) which is by default more compact than the old one
.: Added a column to the download list which shows the date when the download was started

-----------------------
- Feb, 2. 2009        -
-----------------------
.: Kad routing query contacts are checked against the routing table
.: Kad no longer allows more than 2 IPs from the same subnet within one routing query reply (except on LANs)
.: Fixed small bug in the uploadthrottler [tHeWiZaRdOfDoS]

-----------------------
- Jan, 27. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: The Kad UDP firewalltest now asks several clients for its external port, avoiding to get a wrong "Open" state on NATs which change the source port on each request but behave like a Full-Cone otherwise
.: Kad now rechecks incoming search results against the filters used for a search and drops all results which fail (which should only happen for buggy clients and spam results)

-----------------------
- Jan, 25. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: When corrupted part.met files are detected, eMule now automatically tries to use the part.met.bak files instead
.: Some data (like the AICH hashset, statistics, metadata etc) from known/downloaded files which were not shared within the last month now gets purged to save ressources and avoid an unlimited growth of the known.met files
   (the first purge will be done one month after upgrading, if you have "Remember downloaded files" disabled all unshared files are completely deleted right away so this change would have no further effect)
.: If you want to avoid this purging for some reason you can put "PartiallyPurgeOldKnownFiles=0" in the "eMule" section of your preferences.ini

-----------------------
- Jan, 20. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: When sorting lists for file types, eMule now further sorts by extension when the filetype is the equal

-----------------------
- Jan, 11. 2009       -
-----------------------
: On simple search queries Kad now rearrenges the used keywords itself and uses the longest keyword to determine which node to ask. This reduces the search load on common used keyword nodes like "and", makes such keyword a less viable target to attackers and allows users to do a search which begina with a short keyword like "An eMule"
.: You can deactivate this by putting "RearrangeKadSearchKeywords=0" into the "eMule" section of the preferences.in (there isn't much reason to do so for normal users however)

-----------------------
- Jan, 10. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: You can now also share single file and directories by Drag&Drop - simply drag them from (for example) the Windows Explorer into your Shared Files list
.: You can now share and unshare single files in the shared files window by chking/unchecking the files in the "All directories" tree. Downloading files and files in the incoming directory cannot be unshared
   (first one is required for the network  the second one is for consistency as the incoming dir is not handled as optional shared dir, therefore not marked in the tree as shared which again would make it pretty hard to find it to reshare any excluded files)
.: Kad file/source search answers now try to avoid using fragmented packets, making it more compatible to zealous firewalls routers which block those (effect increases as more nodes update to this version)

-----------------------
- Jan, 5. 2009       -
-----------------------
.: Fixed a possible crash in the (minilib) UPnP implementation
.: The Webinterface port can now also be forwarded by UPnP (Options->Webinterface)
.: The UPnP mappings are checked and refreshed if needed before Kad firewallchecks, after waking up from suspend and on smart lowid detection when connecting to servers

-----------------------
- Jan, 3. 2009       -
