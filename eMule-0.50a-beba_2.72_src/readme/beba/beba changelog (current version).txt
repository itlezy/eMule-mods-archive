v2.72 [the bad codename edition]
While digging through my code, I happened to accidentally find a critical scoring issue caused by my own modifications. beba v2.72 fixes the scoring and makes the Client Analyzer probably work correctly for the first time since it was added. I'm positive the issue has finally been smashed. Thanks to dylandog84 for helping me test the fix under real-life conditions. Also I improved beba's version check in terms of design and functionality, made it more obvious and added a couple of small code improvements all over the code. May it do its duty!
