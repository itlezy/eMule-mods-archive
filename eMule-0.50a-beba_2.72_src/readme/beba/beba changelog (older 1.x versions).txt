v1.7 [the big bang edition]:
Bang bang, happy new year! Some improvements, some fixes... hell!
I tried to satisfy all of your wishes, including a quite simple, switchable Release Bonus implementation and MoNKi's automatic shared files reloader. However, beba still ain't a releaser mod, so you still won't get any PowerShare, PowerRelease or something.
(I hereby urge all future beta testers to tell me that they actually test. Just to keep an overview.)

_______________________________________________________
v1.6 [the bellaItalia edition]:
A new version of the famous beba mod, adequately named after one of these days' sunniest countries to have a vacation in. (-;
This version features tits (TITS!) and some changes related to Kad and the recent eD2K server confiscations, including a Nodes.dat updater for a Kad-only configuration. I also found some unexpected graphical beba issues while experimenting with the v1.5, and I casually applied a few more improvements. Here they are:

* October 17 2007

- added: Nodes.dat update via URL [Xanatos]
- added: Tits [Tuxman]
  * note that they are displayed by a random generator; to stop displaying them at all, add the line "EasterEgg=0" to the [beba] section of the file preferences.ini.

- improved: added the obfuscation's padding length setting to the "hidden preferences" [Tuxman]
- improved: auto-clean bad Kad keywords [BlueSonicBoy]
- improved: automatically switch default search type, depending on the network settings [taz]
- improved: better passive source finding [Xman]
- improved: Inform Clients is also valid for eMule+ [Spike2]
- improved: Nodes.dat will be saved every 4 hours [Avi3k/Xanatos]
- improved: request AICH hashset only if necessary [WiZaRd]

- fix (b): Client Analyzer information wasn't displayed (rofl) [Tuxman]
- fix (b): Filename Disparity Check displayed the wrong icon [Tuxman]
- fix (b): Friends Details dialog couldn't be closed correctly [Tuxman]
  * changed the dialog to a basic one [SLUGFILLER/Xanatos]
  * we don't need to call the whole ClientDetailsDialog here ...
- fix (o): unhandled floating point exception in Contact.cpp [NetFinity]

- changed: disabled eD2K network by default [Tuxman]
  * why does anyone need it when there's Kademlia?
- changed: disabled "show dl info on cat tabs" by default again [Tuxman]

_______________________________________________________
v1.5 [the berminator edition]:
Anyone knows the verminator? (-;
Now Slot Focus should finally work smoothly with the Slot Control. Thanks to all beba users who reported the incompatibilities! Besides, some optimizations were made and, due to popular request, SUQWT was finally added. Remember that you may lose any previously gathered credits. :)
(Note: In this changelog I started differenciating between official (o) and beba (b) fixes to avoid it looking like beba being full of bugs, eheh.)

- changed: various small SLS improvements [taken from the X-Ray and Xtreme mods]

- removed: Vista fix - not needed anymore [leuk_he/Xman]

_______________________________________________________
v1.41 [the beta edition]:
Outside the weather goes crazy, so do I: here's a new beba version.
No new features nor important bugfixes, though; if 1.4 runs fine for you, you don't need this version. Nevertheless some of you noticed that beba's new upload slot system doesn't work as great as the old one, so I merged it back. Have fun. :)

v1.3 [the baguette edition]:
A very senseful, but clichéd edition name, isn't it? However, I'm very glad to see that the beba mod has many fans in France. Merci! :-)

_______________________________________________________
v1.2 [the bugs bunny edition]:
Okay, I finally made 1.2 out of the actual 1.1b, there are too many changes, and I didn't really want to continue the broken 1.1 series anymore.
The AHL wasn't implemented well (as you might have noticed, cough), so I decided to change it completely. The (newer) advanced system from the eMF mod seems to be a great solution. Who knows?

  - removed: tons of obsolete code [Tuxman]
    * there still was some code from the Reask Timer... I wonder how it could survive?
	
_______________________________________________________
v1.1a HOTFIX [the beasty edition]:
Whoops. I'm sorry for the inconveniences caused by the 1.1 version. Here's the fixed one.
Finally, the AHL is (should be) working fine. *g*
Special thanks to WiZaRd who helped me to find the bugs listed below...

  * February 11 2007

  - fix: Auto Hard Limit (*cough*) [Tuxman]

v1.01a HOTFIX [the bite me! edition]:
Another day, another try... an error seems to have creeped into the 1.0 major update. It also seems that I had a look at the very wrong place when I added a patch to v1.01. Well, I used my recent days' free time to have a deeper look into the client's core functions, so I could finally verify another patch...

v1.0 [the brand-new edition]:
This version supposed to be v0.6 before, and there were three 0.6 beta versions before starting the 1.x branch. I decided starting 1.x series because of the number of changes since 0.5, and the .47 codebase, of course.
Note to everyone who blamed me for banning "official" clients: This is the first official beba version which uses WiZaRd's Client Analyzer instead of the old Leecher List stuff, so you can now blame WiZaRd instead. :p
