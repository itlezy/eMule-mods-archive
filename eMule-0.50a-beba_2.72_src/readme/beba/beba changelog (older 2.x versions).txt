v2.71 [the beef edition]
Obviously, v2.70 had no major issues left. Time for another small maintenance release with some neat improvements. Thanks to my favorite eMule-Mods.it members for taking their time to test.

* June 4, 2013

- improved: added recognition of some more file types [Tuxman]
- improved: enhanced eD2k filters in Shared Files; applied by folder, listed as subfolders [Tuxman/WiZaRd]

- fix (o): preventing OP_HASHSETREQUEST by invalid clients [Enig123]

- changed: tiny code changes to reduce C4244 warnings [Tuxman]

_______________________________________________________
v2.70 [the beep edition]
This is the start of a new era. As a result of a recently published poll, beba's slogan "feel the lightweight!" was finally confirmed by its audience. I took this as a reason to do some (more and maybe better) work on the logo image. Sorry for my ongoing lack of GFX skills.

In other news: Another project I have been working on (kMule) has let me notice that beba actually lacks something that filters spam results from the search window, so I added WiZaRd's enhanced FakeAlyzer system (originally by NetFinity). A couple of tweaks have been made so beba can finally be (and is) compiled with Visual Studio 2010 now. Also I randomly changed something and stuff. Major hugs to WiZaRd for patiently standing my thick-wittedness.

* March 23, 2013
* compiled with Visual Studio 2010 (finally made the switch)

- added: additional fake check from the search list [WiZaRd/NetFinity]
- added: NeoLoader detection [David Xanatos]

- improved: added recognition of Ogg Theora (.ogv) and TAK (.tak) media files [Tuxman]
- improved: added recognition of some WordPerfect Office document files [Tuxman]
- improved: fixed unfair treatment of clients requesting more than 1 file [eklmn/WiZaRd]
- improved: improved Visual Studio 2010 compatibility [Tuxman/WiZaRd]
- improved: prevent failed UL sessions due to deleted/missing shared files [WiZaRd]
- improved: removed some debug-related functions in release builds [YumeYao]

- fix (o): a double click on the USS status bar item opened the messages window instead of the Tweaks prefs page [Eulero]

- changed: finally fixed the URL in the logo image and did some decent redesign [Tuxman]
- changed: improved the Slot Focus upload list context menu item (clearer display of "enabled"/"disabled") [Tuxman]
- changed: randomly changed something and stuff [Tuxman]
- changed: removed the Slot Focus prefs item (redundant) [Tuxman]
- changed: removed the option to disable Windows 7+ taskbar integration [Tuxman]
- changed: Winsock2 support can not be disabled anymore (removed checkbox) [Tuxman]
  * fallback to Winsock1 has been the default behavior anyway

- removed: support for low color desktops [WiZaRd]
  * people using VS2010-binary compatible systems should not have them anymore. :-)

- updated: Crypto++ v5.6.2 [Tuxman]

_______________________________________________________
v2.65 [the berserk edition]:
WiZaRd recently found an issue with HTTP downloads not working correctly in the official eMule client (thus also in beba). A fix was tested and added.
After having released v2.64, I was told recent Snarl versions (starting with version 2.6) would not ban eMule for "spamming" any longer. If you ran into that issue, I advise you to update Snarl. Also, eMule beba is featured on Snarl's website now. :-)

* June 28, 2012

- fix (b): beba might crash on exit [WiZaRd]
- fix (o): HTTP downloads ending prematurely [WiZaRd]

- changed: fixed weblink to beba's Italian support board [Tuxman]
- changed: "intelligent flushing" checkbox in the prefs comes without the "?" now [Tuxman]
- changed: reworked Snarl notification support [Tuxman]
  * everything is done within the ShowNotifier() function now (thx to WiZaRd for the idea)
  * sound is turned off when using Snarl (brings its own sounds)

- removed: Search Related Files [Tuxman]

- updated: Crypto++ 5.6.1 [Tuxman / WiZaRd]
- updated: zlib 1.2.7 [Tuxman / WiZaRd]

_______________________________________________________
v2.64 [the bourne edition]:
Long time no see, eh? (-;
Suddenly, a wild beba appears and brings a very new very own feature: support for Snarl notifications! Install Snarl and watch the magic happen.
Thanks to WiZaRd for debugging and dev discussions.

* February 11, 2012

- added: block ratio (drop blocking clients) [Stulle, morph4u]
- added: Snarl support [Tuxman]
  * can be turned off in beba's Options dialog

_______________________________________________________
v2.63 [the bingo edition]:
Another small maintenance release in order to cover latest Client Analyzer changes. I also added a tiny new feature that displays the current server's name in your status line when connected, inspired by aMule.

* December 31, 2010

- added: display current server name in status line [Tuxman]

- changed: ASFU 3.5 was still logging as 3.4 [Tuxman]

_______________________________________________________
v2.62 [the between edition]:
Accidentally missed something when updating to .50a. :)

* August 31, 2010

- fix (b): fixed misaligned PPgWebserver page [Tuxman]
- fix (o): SourceForge.net downloads failed [Stulle]

_______________________________________________________
v2.61 [the beloved edition]:
Shortly after having released beba v2.60, I dug through the code again and did some more fine-tuning. This first 2.6x maintenance release fixes some known annoyances. The legendary "Hidden tweaks" are now completely optional, basically hidden themselves, as it (usually) is not really necessary to change anything there. Of course this also affects more common settings like "Show active downloads in bold", but after all I consider it a good idea.

* June 30, 2010

- improved: added the "List All Requested Files" item also to the download clients list [Tuxman]
- improved: the meta data dialog is now correctly depending on "Show ext. controls" [WiZaRd]
- improved: the speedguide link now has a hand cursor :-) [Tuxman]

- fix (b): added a missing check for HAVE_WIN7_SDK_H [Tuxman]
- fix (b): "remove dead servers" did not work properly [Tuxman]
  * note: the name of the prefs entry has been changed during this to avoid further confusion.
- fix (o): the new Shared Files panel was not translated correctly [WiZaRd]

- changed: "Show extended controls" is disabled by default again [Tuxman]
- changed: the Hidden Tweaks section is now hidden unless "Show extended controls" is enabled [Tuxman]

_______________________________________________________
v2.60 [the better edition]:
Now this is more than just a bugfix release due to the new code base. The beba-only changes try to fix some small glitches and feature some rather tiny improvements. Oh, and you can finally choose your own toolbar skins. That's all, basically. Probably I will add more lightweight in a later version.
Special thanks to Spike2 and WiZaRd for important hints and some help with this version.
