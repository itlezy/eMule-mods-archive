to log to, a destination to connect to and a config file to use.

Start a node on the destination machine.

Logs are written to the specified files.

Parse the logs by running parse_log.py <log-file>

The script assumes that gnuplot is installed, and will also
'open' the resulting graphs (wich will open them in the
